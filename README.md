Introduction
------------

A Mezzio 3 Skeleton Application with React.js integration.

## Setup

*1.* Run composer create-project command:

```bash
$ composer create-project samsonasik/mezzio-react
$ composer development-enable
```

*2.* Run PHP Development server

```php
$ cd mezzio-react
$ composer serve
```

*3.* Open web browser http://localhost:8080

## Production

For deploy to production purpose, it has `webpack.config.js` in root directory that when we run `webpack` command, we can get `public/js/dist/bundle.js` after run it. If you don't have a `webpack` installed yet in your system, you can install nodejs and install `webpack` and `webpack-cli`:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g webpack
$ sudo npm install -g webpack-cli
```

So, we can run:

```bash
$ webpack

public/js/dist/bundle.js  3.33 KiB       0  [emitted]  main
Entrypoint main = public/js/dist/bundle.js
[0] ./public/js/app.js + 2 modules 6.32 KiB {0} [built]
    | ./public/js/app.js 1.62 KiB [built]
    | ./public/js/create-page.js 1.36 KiB [built]
    | ./public/js/Navigation.js 3.33 KiB [built]
```

After it generated, we can run the following commands to get `production` environment by default:

```bash
# ensure no left over file development config
$ rm config/development.config.php && rm config/autoload/development.local.php

# install with --no-dev
$ composer install --no-dev

# ensure no left over file cache before re-build cache
$ composer clear-config-cache
```

In `default.phtml`, we have a `isDevelopment()` view helper check to use `js/app.js` when on development, and use `/js/dist/bundle.js` on production when exists.

```php
// src/App/templates/layout/default.phtml
$isDevelopment = $this->isDevelopment();

// ...
    ->prependFile(
        $isDevelopment
            ? '/js/app.js'
            : (
                // when after run webpack, allow to use bundled js
                // fallback to use /js/app.js when not
                file_exists('./public/js/dist/bundle.js')
                    ? '/js/dist/bundle.js'
                    : '/js/app.js'
            ),
        'module'
    )
// ...
```

that will automatically take care of that.
